### _Import several kilograms of fruit from a country in SE Asia, connect with friends in Tokyo who want in!_

&nbsp;

The MVP for this project includes a database of random users in Tokyo with five values:

- first_name: String
- last_name: String
- address: String
- location: {lat: float, lng: float}
- choice: String

Most of the project was spent designing the database and configuring the google maps API. The idea of the app is to find other users who are both:

- A: Close to you
- B: Want the same food as you

Therefore the app centers (permissions allowed) on your current location when you first open it. Random fellow users and their choices are seeded at locations around you.

Configuration of custom users is time consuming as their data must be generated by combining several different APIs, note that Tokyo is on the water and so there is an external request to another API to ensure users are only seeded on the land.
