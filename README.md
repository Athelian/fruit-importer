### _Import several kilograms of fruit from a country in SE Asia, connect with friends in Tokyo who want in!_

&nbsp;

1. Open the screen and see your location on the map üçç
2. See the current locations of other users, and which fruit they are looking for üçâ
3. When mousing over a user, highlight the locations of users looking for the same fruit ü•≠
4. By clicking on a user, join their group for the next order üçì

&nbsp;

The MVP for this project includes a database of random users in Tokyo with five values:

- first_name: String
- last_name: String
- address: String
- location: {lat: float, lng: float}
- choice: String

Most of the project was spent designing the database and configuring the google maps API. The idea of the app is to find other users who are both:

- A: Close to you
- B: Want the same food as you

Therefore the app centers (permissions allowed) on your current location when you first open it. Random fellow users and their choices are seeded at locations around you.

Configuration of custom users is time consuming as their data must be generated by combining several different APIs, note that Tokyo is on the water and so there is an external request to another API to ensure users are only seeded on the land.

A significant portion of the project was spent on designing the interaction when hovering over a marker. The idea is that dotted lines will instantly jutt out to all other users looking for the same fruit, with the purpose being that users can then decide on the meeting location.

Next steps:

- A user can customize an order-group to include only a few people or several people
- A group can set a meeting point
- A group can ask for the app to decide on a logical meeting location automatically, using the GoogleMaps API to search locations until the lowest average travel time per user for one location is found.
- A group can designate a leader to make the order.
- A leader can upload photographic evidence of an invoice and arrival of goods.
- A group can chat in a private channel.
- A group can choose to either pay in cash or through an in-house money-pooling system.
- A user can request support from a moderator in case of a leader falsifying invoices or unfairly distributing goods.
